\maketitle

This document summarizes the contributions of each team member for the Rev 0
Demo.  The time period of interest is the time between the PoC demo and the Rev
0 demo; the contributions prior to the PoC are NOT included.

\section{Demo Plans}

We will be demonstrating our realtime data pipeline, realtime homography, and visualization of gaze data in real time. For the dashbaord, we will demonstrate the updated instructor dashboard, with session tracking and calculated instructor coordinates overlayed on the video feed.

The number of commits made may not accurately depict the amount of work that has been done by each member. Work was done by Manan, Ann and Stanley on the realtime application of the project on a seperate unmerged branch of a seperate private repository (SocialEyes) made from our supervisors. 13 commits were made with a total of 208 additions and 56 deletions.
Angela and Ibrahim worked on more of the research side of the project, gathering data and information of various computer vision libraries to help with the development of the project.

\section{CICD via GitHub Actions}

The team currently uses GitHub Actions for automated LaTeX compilation. 
When documentation files in the \texttt{docs/} directory are modified on a 
push or pull request to the \texttt{main} branch, the workflow automatically 
compiles the changed \texttt{.tex} files to PDF and commits the generated 
PDFs back to the repository. \\

As outlined in the Development Plan, additional CI/CD pipelines for code 
linting (ESLint, Prettier, flake8), automated testing (PyTest for Python, 
Jest for React), and build verification are planned for implementation as 
the codebase matures. These pipelines will be configured to run on every 
pull request and block merges if any job fails.

\end{itemize}

\section{Extras}

As documented in the Problem Statement and confirmed with our supervisors, the team's extras are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Code Walkthrough Report}: A thorough documentation of the files and folders in the GitHub repository, intended to help future developers understand and build upon the project.
    \item \textbf{User Instruction Video}: An instructional video demonstrating how to interact with the dashboard for each user role (e.g., instructor).
\end{enumerate}

These extras remain appropriate for the project. The Code Walkthrough Report aligns well with the modular architecture we've developed (12 modules across hardware-hiding, behaviour-hiding, and software decision layers), and will be valuable for onboarding future contributors to the SocialEyes-based system. The User Instruction Video supports the instructor-facing dashboard, which is a core deliverable. No modifications to the extras plan are recommended at this time.


\section{Team Charter Trigger Items}

The team established clear triggers to maintain accountability and progress. Members are expected to attend one tutorial meeting and one additional weekly meeting, with a 10-minute grace period for lateness. Missing meetings without prior notice or a valid excuse is considered a violation. Tasks are expected to be completed by agreed-upon deadlines, and consistently late or incomplete work triggers follow-up and workload redistribution. Repeated lack of participation, poor-quality work, or uncooperative behavior are also treated as trigger conditions that require team discussion and, if needed, escalation to course staff.

Here are some of the violations that were noted: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Minor punctuality issues occurred occasionally, with some team members arriving late to meetings.
    \item A small number of tasks were submitted past their deadlines due to scheduling or workload constraints.
\end{itemize}

To address these issues, the team created a dedicated Discord channel to clearly communicate deadlines and emphasize timely submissions. For punctuality, we agreed that occasional violations of the 10-minute grace period are acceptable, provided they do not become a recurring pattern.
