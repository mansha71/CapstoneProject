\section{Problem Statement}
\subsection{Problem}
Instructors lack access to real-time insights about where students direct their attention during learning activities, particularly in large-group settings. Without this data, it's hard to assess engagement, monitor collaboration, and adapt teaching strategies to improve the effectiveness of learning. Currently, there is an existing software framework (SocialEyes) used to scale single eye-tracking to multi-person social settings. However, there is a need for a system that can capture and analyze this group gaze data real-time during classroom activities, so that instructors better understand and respond to student attention and engagement in both synchronous and asynchronous learning contexts. 

\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}

\wss{Characterize the problem in terms of ``high level'' inputs and outputs.  
Use abstraction so that you can avoid details.}

        \item May decide on scaling or adopting such systems institution-wide.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Environment}

\subsubsection*{Software Environment}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Version Control and Collaboration:} GitHub will be used for source code management, issue tracking, project boards, and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD).
    \item \textbf{Integrated Development Environment (IDE):} Visual Studio Code (VS Code) will serve as the primary IDE.
\end{itemize}

\section{Goals}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Develop a Learning Platform
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Integrate large-group eye tracking into both synchronous (live classes) 
        and asynchronous (recorded or online activities) learning contexts.
    \end{itemize}

    \item Enable Contextual Data Capture
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Log gaze data alongside classroom learning activities such as passive 
        content viewing (e.g., watching videos) and active group work 
        (e.g., exercises, discussions).
    \end{itemize}

    \item Conduct In-Person Research
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Run a study with instructors and students at McMaster University 
        to evaluate how gaze-based insights affect teaching and learning.
    \end{itemize}

    \item Inform Future System Designs
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Use study findings to guide the development of features like 
        instructor dashboards and real-time gaze analytics.
    \end{itemize}

    \item Tackle Key Technical Challenges
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Address issues in system design, reliable capture of group gaze data, 
        and effective real-time visualization of attention patterns.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Stretch Goals}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Support more complex classroom activities
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Extend the system beyond single-board, lecture-style classes to settings with multiple focal points (for example, group discussions or multiple boards), so it can handle a wider variety of learning environments.
    \end{itemize}

    \item Enhance real-time analytics
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Improve the live feedback available to instructors by going beyond simple engagement markers, while keeping the analytics lightweight enough to scale across many devices.
    \end{itemize}

    \item Strengthen privacy protections
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Ensure the system does not expose sensitive or personally identifiable information. This includes hiding personal details captured by eye cameras and preventing raw video feeds from being directly viewed by researchers or instructors.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Extras}

\wss{For CAS 741: State whether the project is a research project. This
designation, with the approval (or request) of the instructor, can be modified
over the course of the term.}

\wss{For SE Capstone: List your extras.  Potential extras include usability
testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal proof, GenderMag
personas, Design Thinking, etc.  (The full list is on the course outline and in
Lecture 02.) Normally the number of extras will be two.  Approval of the extras

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\wss{Not required for CAS 741}

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    
Stanley: Writing this deliverable went smoothly for me. The reason for this is that I was responsible for creating the team charter (which is on the development plan document), which was a simple process where I came up with some reasonable responses and checked in to see if my team agreed. 

Manan: Writing this deliverable went well because our team was able to communicate effectively and divide the work equally. We were able to discuss our ideas and come to a consensus on how to approach the problem statement and goals. This made the writing process smoother and more efficient.

    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?

Stanley: The only pain point that I experienced was making sure that everyone agreed with the expectations that I wrote (on the development plan document). One member said that if we should let our group know in advance that we will not be able to attend a meeting, that should be reasonable enough for him/her to not show up, which I updated in the expectations later.  

Manan: One pain point was understanding what exactly the proffersors were looking for in this project. We resolved this by discussing as a team and clarifying any doubts we had with the proffersors incharge. 
    \item How did you and your team adjust the scope of your goals to ensure
    they are suitable for a Capstone project (not overly ambitious but also of
    appropriate complexity for a senior design project)?

Stanley: For the most part, we met up with our instructors and team members to discuss how much time and effort we could afford to invest. Through this, we were able to gauge exactly the scope of our project.  

Manan: We adjusted the scope of our goals by discussing as a team and considering the time and resources we had available. We made sure to set realistic and achievable goals that would still challenge us and allow us to learn new skills. We also consulted with our instructors to ensure that our goals were appropriate for a senior design project.
