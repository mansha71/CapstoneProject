\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

\wss{Say what software is being tested.  Give its name and a brief overview of
  its general functions.}

\subsection{Objectives}

\wss{State what is intended to be accomplished.  The objective will be around
  the qualities that are most important for your project.  You might have
  something like: ``build confidence in the software correctness,''
  ``demonstrate adequate usability.'' etc.  You won't list all of the qualities,
  just those that are most important.}

\wss{You should also list the objectives that are out of scope.  You don't have 
the resources to do everything, so what will you be leaving out.  For instance, 
if you are not going to verify the quality of usability, state this.  It is also 
worthwhile to justify why the objectives are left out.}

\wss{The objectives are important because they highlight that you are aware of 
limitations in your resources for verification and validation.  You can't do everything, 
so what are you going to prioritize?  As an example, if your system depends on an 
external library, you can explicitly state that you will assume that external library 
has already been verified by its implementation team.}

\subsection{Extras}

\wss{Summarize the extras (if any) that were tackled by this project.  Extras
can include usability testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal
proof, GenderMag personas, Design Thinking, etc.  Extras should have already
been approved by the course instructor as included in your problem statement.
You can use a pull request to update your extras (in TeamComposition.csv or
Repos.csv) if your plan changes as a result of the VnV planning exercise.}

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

\wss{Reference relevant documentation.  This will definitely include your SRS
  and your other project documents (design documents, like MG, MIS, etc).  You
  can include these even before they are written, since by the time the project
  is done, they will be written.  You can create BibTeX entries for your
  documents and within those entries include a hyperlink to the documents.}

\citet{SRS}

\wss{Don't just list the other documents.  You should explain why they are relevant and 
how they relate to your VnV efforts.}

\section{Plan}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

The Verification and Validation process for this project will involve both the planning and testing teams, as well as the project supervisor and members of the research group.\\

\textbf{Planning team:} Stanley Chen, Ann Shi, and Ibrahim Sahi will be responsible for developing review plans for SRS, VnV, and other documentation, as well as plans for design, implementation and software verification.\\

\textbf{Testing team:} Manan Sharma and Angela Zang will focus on developing and executing system tests that confirm the implementation satisfies the functional and non-functional requirements defined in the SRS.\\

The supervisor and research collaborators will provide support through reviewing and validating the planned systems.

\subsection{SRS Verification}

To ensure that the Software Requirements Specification is accurate, comprehensive, and aligned with the project’s goals, a two-stage review process will be used: a preliminary peer review followed by a structured team review meeting.\\

\textbf{Peer Review}\\

An initial peer review will be conducted by classmates to identify issues in readability, organization, and completeness. This step helps ensure that the SRS communicates effectively to a general audience and that the flow, terminology, and formatting are clear.\\

\textbf{Research Team Review Meeting}\\

A review meeting will be held with the research team during the routine meeting time. This session will combine the technical, instructional, and managerial perspectives required to validate the SRS in a single coordinated effort. During the meeting, a condensed version of the SRS will be presented, highlighting key sections such as system scope, functional and non-functional requirements, datasets, technology dependencies and goals. The review will be guided using a task-based inspection, structured around each participant’s perspective.\\

Instructors will verify that the system goals, use cases, and requirements align well with their needs as the primary users. Researchers will assess the logical soundness of the proposed workflows and ensure that data collection and analysis described in the SRS are technically consistent. The Supervisor will evaluate the overall feasibility of the system, ensuring that the listed technologies, environments, and resources are accessible and that the project remains within defined scope and constraints.\\

Feedback will be collected in real time and logged into the project’s issue tracker for traceability.\\


\subsection{Design Verification}

To ensure that the system design aligns with the functional and non-functional requirements described in the SRS, the team will conduct a structured design review process composed of three complementary activities.\\

First, internal peer review sessions will be held to inspect the Modular Interface Specification (MIS) and system architecture diagrams using a prepared checklist. The checklist will focus on completeness, traceability, modularity, and adherence to design principles such as separation of concerns and single responsibility. Each module (for example, the data ingestion service, analytics engine, and instructor dashboard) will be verified to ensure its interface definitions are consistent with its described purpose and expected data flows.\\

Second, a cross-team review will be conducted with another capstone team to identify design ambiguities and potential integration issues from an external perspective. Feedback from this review will be recorded in the GitHub issue tracker for traceability.\\

Finally, the design documents, including component diagrams and data-flow models, will be presented to the project supervisors for validation of research-specific considerations such as synchronization accuracy between multiple gaze streams and the interpretability of dashboard metrics.\\

Identified defects or improvement items will be categorized as documentation, logic, or scope issues, prioritized, and resolved before implementation. Evidence of completion will be stored as annotated PDFs and issue links within the project repository.\\

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification}

The verification and validation plan will also undergo verification to ensure that it is internally consistent, complete, and feasible given the project timeline. This will be achieved through a combination of peer inspection, supervisor validation, and cross-artifact consistency checks.\\

Classmates will conduct a checklist-based inspection to evaluate the clarity of objectives, completeness of planned tests, and consistency of terminology with the SRS. The supervisors will review the document to confirm that the chosen verification and validation techniques, such as unit testing, usability testing, and performance evaluation, are appropriate for both the engineering and research goals of the project.\\

In addition, the VnV Plan will be cross-checked against the Development Plan and Hazard Analysis documents to ensure that testing activities address identified risks such as privacy concerns or latency issues. Any inconsistencies found will be logged in the issue tracker under the label \texttt{type:docs} and corrected before the next revision. This approach ensures that the VnV Plan remains an up-to-date reflection of the team’s testing progress.\\

\subsection{Implementation Verification}

Implementation verification ensures that the developed system conforms to the verified design and meets the requirements specified in the SRS. Verification will be performed through a combination of automated and manual activities.\\

Automated unit and integration tests will be created for each module of the system, including the backend API, real-time analytics processor, and React dashboard. These will be implemented using PyTest for Python and Jest for JavaScript. Test coverage percentage and pass/fail status will be tracked through GitHub Actions to maintain continuous integration.\\

Static analysis and linting will be performed using ESLint, Prettier, and flake8 to enforce coding standards and detect syntax or style violations. Before Revision 0, the team will conduct a supervised code walkthrough with the project supervisor, where each developer will explain their module’s implementation and trace its connection to the system requirements.\\

Each new feature merged into the main branch will automatically trigger a CI/CD pipeline that runs all tests to prevent regressions. In addition, static verification of documentation will be performed to detect outdated comments or broken references between source code and documentation.\\

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

Automation is a central part of the verification strategy, ensuring that every commit is tested consistently. The following tools and frameworks will be used throughout development.\\

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|p{3cm}|p{4cm}|X|}
\hline
\textbf{Tool} & \textbf{Purpose} & \textbf{Verification Activity} \\
\hline
GitHub Actions & Continuous integration pipeline that runs automatically on each pull request & Executes all test suites, linting, and build checks. Prevents merges if tests fail. \\
\hline
PyTest & Python testing framework for backend and data processing modules & Unit tests for data parsing, computation accuracy, and real-time gaze mapping \\
\hline
Jest and React Testing Library & Front-end testing for user interface components and data visualizations & Verifies correct rendering and state management on the instructor dashboard \\
\hline
ESLint, Prettier, and flake8 & Static code analysis and style enforcement tools & Ensures consistent syntax, formatting, and code quality \\
\hline
Valgrind or cProfile & Profiling and memory analysis tools & Identifies performance bottlenecks and inefficiencies in real-time data handling \\
\hline
Coverage.py and Codecov & Code coverage tracking utilities & Measures test completeness and identifies untested portions of the codebase \\
\hline
Docker & Reproducible environment for testing and deployment & Verifies installability and portability of the full system across different machines \\
\hline
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

At the end of each development iteration, the CI dashboard will export a summary of test coverage, lint violations, and failed cases. These results will be included in the final VnV Report as objective evidence of verification and overall system reliability.\\

\subsection{Software Validation}

\wss{If there is any external data that can be used for validation, you should
  point to it here.  If there are no plans for validation, you should state that
  here.}

\wss{You might want to use review sessions with the stakeholder to check that
the requirements document captures the right requirements.  Maybe task based
inspection?}

\wss{For those capstone teams with an external supervisor, the Rev 0 demo should 
be used as an opportunity to validate the requirements.  You should plan on 
demonstrating your project to your supervisor shortly after the scheduled Rev 0 demo.  
The feedback from your supervisor will be very useful for improving your project.}

\wss{For teams without an external supervisor, user testing can serve the same purpose 
as a Rev 0 demo for the supervisor.}

\wss{This section might reference back to the SRS verification section.}

\section{System Tests}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

This subsection provides concrete, executable tests for all Functional Requirements (FRs) in the SRS.
Tests are grouped by subsystem: Data Acquisition and Ingestion; Data Processing and Analytics; Data
Management and Backend Services; Visualization and Dashboard Interface; and Supporting Infrastructure
(and Stretch). Each test specifies Control, Initial State, Input, Output (expected result), Test Case
Derivation, Test Data / Artefacts, and How the test will be performed.

\section{Unit Test Description}

\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS (detailed design
  document) has been completed.}

\wss{Reference your MIS (detailed design document) and explain your overall
philosophy for test case selection.}  

\wss{To save space and time, it may be an option to provide less detail in this section.  
For the unit tests you can potentially layout your testing strategy here.  That is, you 
can explain how tests will be selected for each module.  For instance, your test building 
approach could be test cases for each access program, including one test for normal behaviour 
and as many tests as needed for edge cases.  Rather than create the details of the input 
and output here, you could point to the unit testing code.  For this to work, you code 
needs to be well-documented, with meaningful names for all of the tests.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
  developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
  verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
  have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Module 1}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
  tests were selected.}

\subsubsection{Module 2}

...

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
  performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
  nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

\wss{These tests may involve collecting performance data from previously
  mentioned functional tests.}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
  \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Angela} Writing this deliverable went fine since I focused on mapping the FR tests to requirements. Having the SRS finalized helped make the traceability and test design process straightforward.  
      \item \textbf{Ann} ...
      \item \textbf{Ibrahim} The team benefitted from meeting with the supervisors and research group prior to completing this deliverable, and had a better and more tangible understanding of the project requirements and goals.
      \item \textbf{Manan} ...
      \item \textbf{Stanley} The SRS was settled, so this went quickly. I mapped FR tests to modules and kept the write-up tight to match the template.
    \end{itemize}
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
  \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Angela} The main challenge was ensuring the test cases aligned correctly with the requirements, especially when some FRs were broad. I resolved this by reviewing our SRS revision and confirming test coverage with the team.
      \item \textbf{Ann} ...
      \item \textbf{Ibrahim} There were some concerns regarding how to format reviews for the documentation, but after meeting with the supervisors, the team was able to work with them to devise a collaborative plan for both the reviews in this deliverable and future documents.
      \item \textbf{Manan} ...
      \item \textbf{Stanley} Hardest part was choosing the right level of detail. I cut jargon and reorganized 3.3–3.6 so they read cleanly.
    \end{itemize}

  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete the verification and validation of your project?
  Examples of possible knowledge and skills include dynamic testing knowledge,
  static testing knowledge, specific tool usage, Valgrind etc.  You should look to
  identify at least one item for each team member.
  \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Angela} I will need to strengthen my understanding of test automation and CI workflows to help verify FR-level functionality efficiently.
      \item \textbf{Ann} ...
      \item \textbf{Ibrahim} It will be helpful to gain a better understanding of the full scope of and the constraints generally applied to testing at this phase of an engineering project.
      \item \textbf{Manan} ...
      \item \textbf{Stanley} I need stronger CI skills to tie PyTest and Jest into one pipeline, and practice writing small, maintainable tests.
    \end{itemize}

  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
  \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Angela} I plan to review CI documentation for GitHub Actions and explore automated testing frameworks like PyTest as it supports the test workflows we will implement later in the project.
      \item \textbf{Ann} ...
      \item \textbf{Ibrahim} I aim to build on this skill by reading into documentation around engineering documents in general, as well as studying past projects.
      \item \textbf{Manan} ...
      \item \textbf{Stanley} Two approaches: (1) study a minimal GitHub Actions template and adapt it; (2) build tiny test jobs in our repo and iterate. I’m starting with (2).
    \end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}
