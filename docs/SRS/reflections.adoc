| Question | Answers

| 1. What went well while writing this deliverable?
|
Angela:: Writing the SRS went smoothly once the team aligned on the project’s core features and goals. We had a solid foundation from our previous deliverables, which helped structure the functional and non-functional requirements clearly. Using consistent templates and referencing our earlier documents made it easier to make sure of traceability. Communication within the team improved during this phase, and once the initial draft was set up, it was easier for everyone to contribute and refine their respective sections. +
Ann:: Overall, the deliverable went well. I took the feedback received from the previous milestone (Development Plan and Goals) and applied it to this milestone. For example, I fixed the goals that I wrote in for the Goals section of this deliverable based on critiques I got on the goals being too specific and more like functional requirements. +
Ibrahim:: +
Manan:: The communication and team work was smooth while working on this deliverable. It made the process much easier.
Stanley:: +

| 2. What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how did you resolve them?
|
Angela:: There were a few challenges while writing this deliverable. Many of our requirements still have TBD values that need verification with our supervisors, so we had to make several assumptions to maintain progress. It was also tricky coordinating with everyone’s schedules to review the SRS together. However, we handled these challenges by maintaining active discussions on call and by clearly noting all assumptions so we can revisit them after our next supervisor meeting. +
Ann:: This deliverable however, was very long and time consuming. I felt that if there was more time given, I would’ve had more time to communicate with professors and my teammates for a more aligned report. +
Ibrahim:: +
Manan:: There was some pain points trying to determine what components of the SRS were required. It took some time to understand the expectations for the project.
Stanley:: +

| 3. How many of your requirements were inspired by speaking to your client(s) or their proxies (e.g. your peers, stakeholders, potential users)?
|
Angela:: A good portion of our requirements came from our understanding of what the supervisors are expecting from the project, based on our earlier meetings and clarifications. We also spent time discussing ideas with teammates to refine the scope and ensure the requirements made sense in the context of our prototype. Also, we looked back at lecture slides and example capstone projects to structure our requirements list properly and make sure they were specific, measurable, and testable. +
Ann:: We mainly got our requirements through our supervisors. During our meetings together as well as a google docs of our main goals and functional requirements of the project, we were able to get a good understanding of the different types of functional and non-functional requirements of the project. +
Ibrahim:: +
Manan:: Most of the requirements came from discussions we had with the profferssors of the course. This helped us understand their needs and what they were looking for.
Stanley:: +

| 4. Which of the courses you have taken, or are currently taking, will help your team to be successful with your capstone project?
|
Angela:: 3RA3 and 4HC3. 3RA3 helped in formalizing requirements and using consistent terminology, while 4HC3 provided good insight into designing usable interfaces. This was helpful when thinking about the instructor dashboard component of our system. I’ve completed both of these courses, and their content directly helped how I approached writing this deliverable. +
Ann:: The previous course I took, Software Requirements (3RA3) with Dr. Mosser was extremely beneficial in this deliverable. I continuously referenced my old project / report that I had to submit for that course, as it was very reminiscent of this deliverable. +
Ibrahim:: +
Manan:: I've taken many project based courses that will for sure help me in this course. Courses such as 2AA4 and 3RA3 are some examples of courses that I believe will help me.
Stanley:: +

| 5. What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to successfully complete this capstone project?  
Examples: domain knowledge, software engineering skills, mechatronics, communication, writing, or management.
|
Angela:: We’ll need to build more domain knowledge around eye-tracking analytics and data synchronization. Some hardware familiarity with the Pupil Labs Neon devices will also be helpful as we start working on the system. On the soft-skills side, we need to continue improving communication and coordination since a lot of our tasks depend on effective collaboration and timely feedback. Some project management skills would also be helpful. +
Ann:: We will definitely need to set up weekly meetings with our supervisors to collect more requirements as the project goes on. So far, we have already done that. We need to collect more feedback on the details of the functional requirements, as well as any metrics from the professor on how to achieve our goals. We will spend time on in-person meetings with our supervisors to learn more about the existing framework we are building upon (SocialEyes) as well as the equipment needed to interact with the system (eye-tracking glasses). Aside from project knowledge, our group members will need to spend some time on the side to learn more about web development for the dashboard as well as how to critically deal with large data and provide analysis and insights. +
Ibrahim:: +
Manan:: We need strong communication skills and strong programming fundamentals. Expertise in both backend and frontend will be required.
Stanley:: +

| 6. For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified above, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or mastering the skill?  
Which approach will each team member pursue, and why?
|
Angela:: For domain knowledge, one approach is to study existing frameworks like SocialEyes in more depth, and another is to review relevant academic literature on gaze analytics and engagement metrics. For hardware familiarity, we can schedule hands-on practice sessions once the Neon device is available. To improve communication and project management, we’ll continue using GitHub Issues and calls actively, and hold short, focused weekly sync-ups to stay aligned. +
Ann:: One of the ways we can pursue these sources of knowledge is through documentation as well as online Youtube tutorials to learn any software skills required. For example, for members who are unfamiliar with full-stack development, there are a wide variety of different youtube tutorials that can be used to learn these skills. +
Ibrahim:: +
Manan:: Looking for online resources and seeking documentation from credible sources will help us better structure our project and the development.
Stanley:: +
