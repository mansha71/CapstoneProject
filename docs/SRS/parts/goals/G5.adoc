**UC1: Conduct a Lecture with Eye-Tracking**

1. Instructor logs into the learning platform using their account.  
2. Instructor starts a lecture session with eye-tracking enabled.  
3. The system activates group eye-tracking through classroom cameras or integrated headsets.  
4. Real-time gaze data is collected and mapped to student identities.  
5. The instructor can monitor live attention heatmaps and engagement indicators.  
6. At the end of the session, summary analytics (e.g., attention distribution, gaze convergence) are automatically generated.

**UC2: Review Post-Session Analytics**

1. Instructor logs into the dashboard after a lecture.  
2. The system displays visual analytics (e.g., attention heatmaps, engagement timelines, group focus zones).  
3. Instructor filters data by session, topic, or student group.  
4. Instructor identifies segments where student attention decreased.  
5. Instructor reviews suggested insights (e.g., “Attention drop detected during explanation slides”).  
6. Instructor saves session summary or exports a report for research analysis.

**UC3: Integrate Learning Outcome Data**


1. Instructor uploads or links external performance data (e.g., quiz scores, feedback forms).  
2. The system synchronizes outcome data with gaze data timelines.  
3. Instructor or researcher compares engagement patterns with learning performance.  
4. The system highlights correlations between gaze focus and comprehension metrics.
