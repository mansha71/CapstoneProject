[#s.4.1,reftext=S.4.1]
==== (S.4.1) Scenario 1 – Conducting a Lecture with Eye-Tracking (UC1)
*Primary Actor:* Instructor

*Precondition:* Instructor has a valid account; classroom cameras/headsets are set up.

*Trigger:* Instructor wants to start a lecture session with real-time monitoring.

.Main Success Scenario
. Instructor logs into the platform.
. Instructor starts a lecture session with eye-tracking enabled.
. System activates group eye-tracking (cameras/headsets).
. Real-time gaze data is collected and mapped to student identities.
. Instructor monitors live attention heatmaps and engagement indicators.
. Instructor delivers content while adjusting teaching strategies based on real-time feedback.
. At session end, system generates summary analytics (attention distribution, gaze convergence, engagement patterns).

.Secondary Scenarios
. Eye-tracking devices fail to initialize; system alerts instructor with troubleshooting steps.
. Instructor disables real-time monitoring temporarily.
. Summary analytics generation fails; instructor can manually export raw gaze data.

*Success Postcondition:* Lecture is completed; gaze data and analytics are available.

[#s.4.2,reftext=S.4.2]
==== (S.4.2) Scenario 2 – Reviewing Post-Session Analytics (UC2)
*Primary Actor:* Instructor

*Precondition:* Gaze data has been collected.

*Trigger:* Instructor wants to analyze student attention and engagement.

.Main Success Scenario
. Instructor logs into the analytics dashboard.
. System displays visual analytics (heatmaps, timelines, focus zones).
. Instructor filters data by session, topic, or student group.
. Instructor identifies segments with attention drops.
. Instructor reviews suggested insights.
. Instructor saves session summary or exports report for research analysis.

.Secondary Scenarios
. Filter selection returns no data; system prompts to adjust criteria.
. Suggested insights unavailable; instructor manually annotates key moments.
. Export fails due to network error; system retries or provides alternate download.

*Success Postcondition:* Instructor has actionable post-session analytics for teaching or research.

[#s.4.3,reftext=S.4.3]
==== (S.4.3) Scenario 3 – Integrating Learning Outcome Data (UC3)
*Primary Actor:* Instructor / Researcher

*Precondition:* Gaze data collected; learning outcome data available.

*Trigger:* Instructor/researcher wants to correlate engagement with performance.

.Main Success Scenario
. Instructor uploads or links external learning outcome data.
. System synchronizes outcome data with gaze data timelines.
. Instructor/researcher compares engagement patterns with performance metrics.
. System highlights correlations between gaze focus and comprehension metrics.
. Reports or visualizations are generated linking attention to outcomes.

.Secondary Scenarios
. Outcome data is incompatible; system prompts for format correction.
. Synchronization fails; system logs error and notifies instructor.
. No correlations detected; system suggests alternative visualizations or longer observation period.

*Success Postcondition:* Learning outcome data is integrated with gaze analytics.

[#s.4.4,reftext=S.4.4]
==== (S.4.4) Scenario 4 – Real-Time Attention Alerts (UC1 + UC2)
*Primary Actor:* Instructor

*Precondition:* Lecture session running; gaze data being collected.

*Trigger:* Instructor wants to detect attention drops in real time.

.Main Success Scenario
. System monitors gaze data continuously.
. Attention metrics drop below threshold for a student/group.
. System generates real-time alert on instructor dashboard.
. Instructor takes action: pause lecture, repeat content, or engage students.
. System logs event for post-session analytics.

.Secondary Scenarios
. Alert triggered incorrectly due to system noise; instructor can dismiss/adjust sensitivity.
. Network latency delays alert; system flags potential inaccuracies.

*Success Postcondition:* Instructor can intervene in real time; events logged.

[#s.4.5,reftext=S.4.5]
==== (S.4.5) Scenario 5 – Multi-Session and Comparative Analysis (UC2 + UC3)
*Primary Actor:* Instructor / Researcher

*Precondition:* Multiple sessions with gaze and outcome data collected.

*Trigger:* Instructor/researcher wants to compare attention across sessions.

.Main Success Scenario
. Instructor selects multiple past sessions.
. System generates comparative analytics (heatmaps, engagement timelines, gaze convergence).
. Instructor filters/groups students to identify patterns.
. Correlations with learning outcome data displayed.
. Instructor identifies topics with consistently low attention/performance.

.Secondary Scenarios
. Some sessions lack complete data; system flags incomplete datasets.
. Visualization fails with large datasets; system provides CSV summary export.

*Success Postcondition:* Instructor/researcher identifies trends and adjusts teaching strategies or research focus.
