=== (S.5) Prioritization

The MoSCoW method (Must Have / Should Have / Could Have) was used to prioritize all requirements according to their impact on system functionality, ethical compliance, user experience, and feasibility.  
High-priority (“Must Have”) items are essential for the Rev 0 proof-of-concept.  
Medium (“Should Have”) items enhance robustness or usability.  
Low (“Could Have”) items are stretch goals for later revisions.

High-priority (“Must Have”) items such as <<FR-1>>, <<FR-3>>, <<FR-7>>, <<FR-14>>, <<FR-15>>, <<FR-19>>, <<FR-20>>, <<FR-26>>, <<FR-27>>, and <<NFR-9>>–<<NFR-11>>, <<NFR-21>>–<<NFR-24>>, <<NFR-26>> define the minimum viable and ethically deployable system.  
Medium-priority items strengthen reliability, maintainability, and usability, while low-priority items represent stretch enhancements for Rev 1 expansion (e.g., multi-device scaling, replay tooling, or anonymized visualization export).

Security, privacy, and ethical safeguards remain top priority; deployment would not be acceptable without <<FR-14>>, <<FR-27>>, <<NFR-9>>, <<NFR-10>>, and <<NFR-11>>, which together protect participant data and ensure compliance with institutional research ethics.
