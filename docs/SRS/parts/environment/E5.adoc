TIP: _Elements and properties of the environment that the system will affect. It defines effects of the system's operations on properties of the environment. Where the previous two categories (<<e3>>, <<e4>>) defined influences of the environment on the system, effects are influences in the reverse direction._  <<BM22>>

The following subsections describe the anticipated effects of the SocialEyes system on its surrounding environment.

*On Instructors*::
- Instructors will gain access to real-time visualizations of student attention, enabling adaptive instructional strategies during live sessions.
- Post-session analytics will provide instructors with new data sources for evaluating engagement and participation trends.

*On Students*::
- Studentsâ€™ gaze data will be collected during classroom sessions, raising considerations regarding privacy and observation.
- Students may experience indirect changes in teaching methods as instructors respond to engagement data (e.g., adjusting pacing, focus, or activities).
- Participation in gaze tracking may slightly alter student behavior (Hawthorne effect).

*On Classroom Dynamics*::
- The system may shift classroom norms by making engagement more observable and measurable.
- The presence of wearable eye-tracking devices may influence how students interact with one another and with the instructor.

*On Institutional Processes*::
- Universities may need to establish or update data governance policies for the secure handling of gaze data and analytics.
- Research ethics compliance processes may expand to include gaze-based analytics as part of study review and approval.

*On Technical Environment*::
- Network and local storage usage in classrooms will increase due to simultaneous streaming and recording of gaze and egoview data.
- Classroom audiovisual setups may require integration of additional components such as a central camera and backend server equipment.

*On Future Research and Innovation*::
- The collected datasets may enable new research directions in learning analytics, social gaze dynamics, and multimodal attention analysis.
