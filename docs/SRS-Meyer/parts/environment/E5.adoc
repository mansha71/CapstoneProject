=== (E.5) Effects

ifdef::env-draft[]
TIP: _Elements and properties of the environment that the system will affect. It defines effects of the system's operations on properties of the environment. Where the previous two categories (<<e3>>, <<e4>>) defined influences of the environment on the system, effects are influences in the reverse direction._  <<BM22>>

*On Instructors*::
- Instructors will gain access to real-time visualizations of student attention, allowing them to adapt teaching strategies dynamically.
- Post-session analytics will provide instructors with new data sources to evaluate class engagement and participation.

*On Students*::
- Studentsâ€™ gaze data will be collected during classroom sessions, introducing potential concerns about privacy and observation.
- Students may experience indirect changes in teaching methods as instructors respond to engagement data (e.g., adjusting pacing, focus, or activities).
- Participation in gaze tracking may slightly alter student behavior (Hawthorne effect).

*On Classroom Dynamics*::
- The system may shift classroom norms by making engagement more observable and measurable.
- The presence of wearable devices (eye-trackers) may influence how students interact with each other and with the instructor.

*On Institutional Processes*::
- Universities may need to establish or adapt data governance policies for handling gaze data and related analytics.
- Research ethics compliance processes may expand to include gaze-based analytics as part of study approvals.

*On Technical Environment*::
- Network and storage usage in classrooms will increase due to simultaneous streaming and recording of gaze/egoview data.
- Classroom AV setups may need to accommodate a central camera (centralview) and backend server equipment.

*On Future Research*::
- The collected datasets may enable new directions for research in learning analytics, social gaze dynamics, and multimodal attention analysis.
