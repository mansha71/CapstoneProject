TIP: _Properties of the environment that the system's operation must preserve, i.e., properties of the environment that operations of the system may assume to hold when they start, and must maintain_  <<BM22>>
endif::[]

*Privacy and Ethics*::
- The system must preserve the anonymity of student participants; no operation should introduce identifiable personal data without explicit consent.
- Ethical approval requirements must remain satisfied throughout all system use.

*Data Integrity*::
- Raw gaze data must remain unaltered during collection and storage; preprocessing or anonymization must not compromise its validity.
- Timestamps across multiple devices must remain synchronized to a common reference clock (within acceptable *TBD tolerance*).

*System Reliability*::
- The system must preserve consistent availability of core functionality (real-time analytics and post-session analysis) even if some devices disconnect or fail.
- Device disconnections or frame drops must not corrupt existing stored data.

*Classroom Environment*::
- Normal classroom operations (teaching, student interactions) must not be disrupted beyond wearing the devices and central camera presence.
- The system must not interfere with existing classroom AV or IT infrastructure.

*Licensing and Usage*::
- The system must remain compliant with the Non-Commercial Research License (NCRL-1.0) of the SocialEyes framework and related components.
- Open-source dependencies must be used within their licensing terms.

*Security*::
- The system must ensure that any networked operations (streaming, storage) do not compromise institutional IT security policies.
- Access to dashboards and analytics must always remain restricted to authorized roles (e.g., instructors, researchers).
