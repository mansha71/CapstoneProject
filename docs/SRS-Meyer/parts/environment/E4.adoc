=== (E.4) Assumptions

ifdef::env-draft[]
TIP: _Properties of the environment that may be assumed, with the goal of facilitating the project and simplifying the system. It defines properties that are not imposed by the environment (like those in <<e3>>) but assumed to hold, as an explicit decision meant to facilitate the system's construction._  <<BM22>>

*Classroom and Connectivity*::
- A stable wireless network will be available in the classroom to connect eye-tracking devices to the backend.
- Network latency and bandwidth will be within acceptable limits for real-time analytics (*TBD thresholds*).

*Hardware Availability*::
- Each student participant will be equipped with a functional pair of Pupil Labs Neon glasses paired with a smartphone running the Neon Companion App.
- The instructor will have access to a laptop or desktop capable of running the dashboard and backend software.

*Data and Usage*::
- Students will consent to the collection of gaze data for the purposes of this research project.
- Gaze data will be sufficient in quality for analysis, assuming minimal calibration drift and device malfunction.
- The volume of gaze data generated will not exceed storage capacity or post-processing capabilities within the projectâ€™s timeline.

*Software and Frameworks*::
- The SocialEyes framework will remain available and maintainable during the course of the project.
- Dependencies (e.g., Pupil Labs API, Docker, Python libraries) will continue to be supported and compatible with the project environment.
- Supervisors and project stakeholders accept the use of open-source components under non-commercial research licenses.

*Operational Context*::
- Classroom activities will be structured in ways that make gaze analysis meaningful (e.g., students facing a shared board, screen, or instructor).
- The system will be used primarily in controlled classroom/lab settings, not large-scale public venues.
- Users (instructors) will have basic technical literacy and be able to operate the dashboard without extensive training.
