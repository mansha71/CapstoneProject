=== (E.4) Assumptions

ifdef::env-draft[]
TIP: _Properties of the environment that may be assumed, with the goal of facilitating the project and simplifying the system. It defines properties that are not imposed by the environment (like those in <<e3>>) but assumed to hold, as an explicit decision meant to facilitate the system's construction._  <<BM22>>

*Classroom and Connectivity*::
- A stable wireless network will be available in the classroom to connect eye-tracking devices to the backend.
- Network latency and bandwidth are expected to remain within acceptable thresholds for real-time analytics (*exact thresholds to be determined during testing*).

*Hardware Availability*::
- Each student participant will be equipped with a functional pair of Pupil Labs Neon glasses paired with a smartphone running the Neon Companion App.
- The instructor will have access to a laptop or desktop capable of running the dashboard and backend software.

*Data and Usage*::
- All participants will provide informed consent for gaze data collection as part of the research protocol.
- Gaze data quality will be sufficient for analysis, assuming minimal calibration drift and device malfunction.
- The volume of gaze data generated per session will remain within local storage limits (< *TBD* GB) and post-processing time (< *TBD* minutes per hour of recording*).

*Software and Frameworks*::
- The SocialEyes framework will remain available and maintainable during the course of the project.
- Dependencies such as the Pupil Labs API, Docker, and Python libraries will continue to be supported and compatible with the project environment.
- Supervisors and stakeholders accept the use of open-source components under non-commercial research licenses.

*Operational Context*::
- Classroom activities will be structured in ways that make gaze analysis meaningful (e.g., students facing a shared display or instructor).
- The system will be used primarily in controlled classroom or lab settings, not in large-scale public venues.
- Users (instructors) will possess sufficient technical literacy to operate the dashboard without specialized training.

If any of these assumptions fail to hold (ex. unstable network connectivity or deprecated dependencies), appropriate mitigation or contingency actions will be defined during validation and integration testing.
