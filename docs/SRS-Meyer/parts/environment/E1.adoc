*Eye-tracking (ET)*::
  The process of measuring where a person is looking (the gaze point) using specialized hardware, such as wearable glasses.

*Pupil Labs Neon*::
  A wearable eye-tracking device that records gaze data through eye cameras (192x192 px at 200 Hz) and a front-facing egoview camera (1600x1200 px at 30 Hz).

*Gaze Data*::
  Data collected from eye-tracking devices, including eye images, gaze coordinates, and egoview video streams.

*SocialEyes Framework*::
  An open-source system architecture for multi-person, mobile eye-tracking in real-world settings. Provides modules for recording, streaming, homography, analysis, and visualization.

*Instructor Dashboard*::
  A web-based user interface (React/TypeScript) for instructors to visualize and interpret gaze analytics, both in real-time and after learning sessions.

*Real-time Analytics*::
  Processing and visualization of gaze data as it is captured, providing immediate insights into attention and engagement.

*Post-session Analytics*::
  Analysis of gaze data collected during a session, processed afterward to provide detailed engagement metrics.

*Engagement Metrics*::
  Quantitative or qualitative measures derived from gaze data to indicate student attention, focus, and participation during learning activities.

*Synchronous Learning*::
  Learning activities that occur live (e.g., lectures, discussions), where gaze analytics can provide real-time feedback.

*Asynchronous Learning*::
  Learning activities where students engage at different times, with analytics reviewed after the fact.

*Egoview*::
  The first-person video stream captured by the eye-tracking glasses’ front-facing camera, representing the wearer’s perspective.

*Centralview*::
  A shared video stream of the scene, captured by a stationary camera. Used as the reference frame for projecting multiple egoviews into a common space.

*Homography*::
  A projective transformation technique used to map gaze coordinates from egoview (individual perspective) into centralview (shared perspective).

*Semantic Gaze Mapping*::
  The alignment of multiple users’ gaze data into a shared coordinate system, enabling collective gaze analysis.

*Heatmap (Gaze Heatmap)*::
  A visualization of gaze density across a scene, highlighting areas of shared attention.

*GlassesRecord Module*::
  A SocialEyes module used to trigger, record, and monitor data collection from multiple eye-tracking glasses simultaneously.

*CentralCam Module*::
  A SocialEyes module that manages the central camera feed, synchronizes, and records the shared scene.

*GlassesStream Module*::
  A SocialEyes module for streaming gaze and egoview data in real time.

*Flask Monitor*::
  A real-time web application for visualizing incoming data streams (egoview, gaze, centralview) and monitoring system status.

*Visualisation Module*::
  Produces overlays and heatmaps combining egoview, gaze data, and centralview for interpreting group attention.

*Analysis Module*::
  Provides collective gaze metrics, including gaze entropy, velocity, heatmap similarity, correlation, and normalized contour area.

*Stationary Gaze Entropy*::
  A measure of unpredictability or dispersion in gaze distribution, calculated from gaze coordinates over a given time frame.

*Normalized Contour Area*::
  A metric representing the area of the convex hull around all gaze points at a given time, used to quantify collective gaze dispersion.

*Time Synchronisation (NTP)*::
  The use of a Network Time Protocol server to align timestamps across multiple devices, ensuring synchronised data streams.

*SuperGlue*::
  A graph neural network-based feature matching algorithm used to align egoview and centralview in the SocialEyes homography module.

*Recording Mode*::
  A SocialEyes operation mode where data are collected and stored for offline, post-hoc analysis.

*Streaming Mode*::
  A SocialEyes operation mode where data are collected and processed concurrently for immediate visualization.

*Recording + Streaming Mode*::
  A hybrid operation where raw data is recorded while simultaneously processing gaze streams in real time.

*Pupil Labs Neon Companion App*::
  The Android application that interfaces with Neon glasses, enabling remote control, recording, and streaming of gaze and egoview data.

*Egocentric Gaze*::
  Raw gaze data recorded relative to the wearer’s own perspective (egoview), not yet projected into centralview space.

*Collective Gaze Dynamics*::
  Patterns of group attention and coordination revealed by analyzing synchronised gaze data from multiple users.

*CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery)*::
  A software engineering practice involving automated building, testing, and deployment pipelines.

*API (Application Programming Interface)*::
  Defined methods and data formats that allow system components or external applications to communicate.

*Role-based Access Control (RBAC)*::
  A security model that restricts or allows access to system features based on assigned user roles (e.g., instructor, researcher).

*Data Anonymization*::
  The removal or obfuscation of personally identifiable information from gaze data to protect participant privacy.
