=== (E.3) Constraints

ifdef::env-draft[]
TIP: _Obligations and limits imposed on the project and system by the environment. This chapter defines non-negotiable restrictions coming from the environment (business rules, physical laws, engineering decisions), which the development will have to take into account._  <<BM22>>

*Privacy and Ethics*::
- All gaze data must be anonymized to protect participant identity and comply with research ethics requirements.
- No identifiable video or audio may be stored or displayed without explicit consent.

*Hardware Limitations*::
- Pupil Labs Neon glasses operate at fixed specifications (gaze at 200 Hz; egoview video at 30 Hz).
- Each Neon device must pair with a smartphone running the Neon Companion App, which constrains connectivity and data routing.
- Each device requires network bandwidth of approximately *TBD MB/s* (to be confirmed based on supervisor guidance and test environment).

*Infrastructure and Environment*::
- The system must operate in classrooms with variable Wi-Fi reliability; Ethernet availability cannot be assumed.
- Processing must be feasible on commodity instructor laptops/desktops with *TBD minimum specifications* (to be confirmed).

*Integration and Dependencies*::
- The system depends on the Pupil Labs real-time API and Neon Companion App. Any vendor limitations or failures directly constrain system functionality.
- The system incorporates the SocialEyes framework and related open-source libraries; compatibility and updates are subject to those external projects.

*Performance and Responsiveness*::
- Real-time analytics must display with a maximum latency of *TBD seconds* between gaze capture and dashboard visualization.
- The system must support at least *TBD concurrent users* for classroom-scale deployment (to be confirmed).
- Data loss from dropped frames, network jitter, or device disconnects must be handled gracefully.

*Legal and Licensing*::
- The SocialEyes framework is licensed under a Non-Commercial Research License (NCRL-1.0), restricting usage to academic/non-commercial contexts.
- Third-party submodules (e.g., SuperGlue) are subject to academic/non-commercial research licenses.

*Engineering Decisions*::
- The system will prioritize classroom-scale scalability (typical class size *TBD users*).
- Advanced analyses (e.g., deep learningâ€“based homography) will run offline/post-session due to hardware constraints on instructor devices.
