Requirements were prioritized using the MoSCoW method based on their impact on core functionality, user experience, research ethics, and feasibility. High-priority (“Must Have”) items are essential for capturing, processing, and securely visualizing eye-tracking data. Medium-priority (“Should Have”) items improve usability, maintainability, and flexibility but are not mandatory for the Rev 0 proof-of-concept. Low-priority (“Could Have”) items are stretch goals for later revisions (e.g., multi-device central camera workflows, replay tooling).

Security concerns played a central role. Encryption, authentication/authorization, and anonymization (<<FR-14>>, <<NFR-9>>, <<NFR-11>>, <<NFR-10>>) are “Must Have” because they protect participant data and ensure compliance with institutional research ethics; without them, classroom deployment would not be acceptable.
